# How the NSA Kubernetes Hardening guide applies to Rancher and RKE2

![logo](img/nsa_banner.jpg)

At a high level, [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/) and [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov) developed a Kubernetes hardening [guide](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/03/15/updated-kubernetes-hardening-guide
).

> NSA and CISA developed this document in furtherance of their respective cybersecurity missions, including their responsibilities to develop and issue cybersecurity specifications and mitigations. This information may be shared broadly to reach all appropriate stakeholders.

This article will help apply the recommendations to Rancher and RKE2 (Ranchers Government focused Kubernetes.)

## What is the NSA Kubernetes Hardening Guide

In March of 2022 the [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/) released an updated version of the hardening [guide](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ncas/current-activity/2022/03/15/updated-kubernetes-hardening-guide
). We should probably level set a little on what Kubernetes is. From the guide itself.
> Kubernetes® is an open-source system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications run in containers, and is often hosted in a cloud environment.
Since Kubernetes is open-source there are about a dozen different distributions for it.
